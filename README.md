EuroMobi2012
============

EuroMobi is a simple web app to keep track our internal office Euro 2012 picks and to hold a leaderboard that anyone can view at any time :)

For the dev team though, this is an exercise to see how fast we could build a functional web app with frameworks like Meteor.js

I don't actually expect anyone to use this (though you can) since it's full of quirks but it's something to build off of and get rid of that damn spreadsheet!

## Quirks

- Users can only make their selection ONCE. Once chosen, their data is locked in
- The 'admin' name is essentially god-mode. Everyones score is compared against that model and you can edit results through the name
